// Temporary integration plan and state-lifting notes for ExerciseTimerModal integration

/**
 * Integration Plan for ExerciseTimerModal with Workout Page
 *
 * 1. Add state to WorkoutPage to manage:
 *    - isTimerModalOpen (boolean)
 *    - timerModalExerciseId (string | null)
 *
 * 2. When the timer play button is clicked for an exercise:
 *    - Set timerModalExerciseId to the exercise's id
 *    - Set isTimerModalOpen to true
 *
 * 3. Pass the current exercise's details (name, reps, weight, set count, timer state) to ExerciseTimerModal
 *    - Timer state should be managed in WorkoutPage and passed as props
 *    - Modal should receive callbacks for play/pause, rest, and done actions
 *
 * 4. On "Done" in the modal:
 *    - Mark set as complete (call existing logic)
 *    - Close modal and reset timerModalExerciseId
 *
 * 5. On "Rest" in the modal:
 *    - Pause timer, trigger rest modal (existing logic)
 *    - Modal can close or stay open depending on UX
 *
 * 6. Ensure timer state is not duplicated:
 *    - Remove timer logic from ExerciseTimerModal
 *    - Use timer state from WorkoutPage only
 *    - Modal is purely presentational and receives all state via props
 *
 * 7. Refactor WorkoutPage to remove direct timer controls from inline UI
 *    - Replace timer play/pause button with modal trigger
 *    - Only one modal can be open at a time
 *
 * 8. Test for edge cases:
 *    - Navigating away with modal open
 *    - Completing set from modal
 *    - Rest/Resume from modal
 *    - Responsive and accessibility
